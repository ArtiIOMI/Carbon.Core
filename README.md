## Introduction
Carbon is an anticipated system designed for lower-to-higher-end **Rust** servers with top priority for best performance and memory optimization, which is compatible with most - if not all - **Oxide** plugins currently out in the market, and a lot more features!

Join our official [Discord server][discord] for more frequent development info, discussions and future plans.

## Documentation

For more in-depth Carbon documentation, from builds and deployment, check [here][documentation].

Find all currently available hooks [here][5].
We're open for your support to add any missing hooks that you want [here][6].

## Features
* Extremely lightweight, stripped out of additional, unrelated-to-Rust processes
* Seamless transition from Oxide to Carbon
* Permissions system
* Hook system
* MySQL & SQLite support
* DRM support
* Chat, Console and Covalence support
* Built in Carbon Modules (internal plugins) that help your server for the better
* Carbon-only methods that speed up and better the performance of your plugins
* Integrated RustEdit extensions (Module)
* Integrated Stack manager (Module)
* Integrated Gather manager (Module)
* Embedded error/exception Demystifier which shows accurate error outputs
* Very fast & helpful error handling for plugin compilation

## Running Carbon

### Flavors
Carbon has three different main flavors.

- ü•á [Production]: the most stable version,
- ü•à [Staging]: the preview version, could be unstable,
- ü•â [Development]: the bleeding edge, where new things are born üçº.

In general most people is advised to get the latest stable version which is the only one considered to be production ready.

### How to install
1. Download the latest version of Carbon from Carbon's Github [release page][2].
2. Unzip the archive to the root of your Rust Dedicated Server.
3. Restart the server and enjoy üéâ.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are installing on a üêß Linux host you will need to execute the `carbon/tools/environment.sh` script before starting your server.
This script will prepare the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_PRELOAD` env to execute Unity Doorstop automatically.
Update your scripts to always source `source carbon/tools/environment.sh` before starting the game server.

#### Pterodactyl
1. Download [this file][3] and save it locally as `egg-rust-carbon.json`.
2. Open your Pterodactyl admin panel and go to the `Nests` section.
3. Click `Import Egg` and browse for the file you've just downloaded.
4. Select `Rust` as your `Associated Nest` and import.

From here you can build a new Rust server with Carbon as your selected egg.

The source code for this egg is also [available on Github][4].
For help and support, join [Carbon's Discord server][discord] and `@RustRadio`.

## Building Carbon

This following instructions were written for ü™ü Windows environments but Carbon can be built on üêß Linux hosts as well.
The project has been successfully built using:
  - Visual Studio 2019/2022 (ü™ü)
  - Visual Studio Code (ü™ü, üêß)

### Preparing the buildroot

1. ‚¨áÔ∏è Clone [the project][1] on your machine.
2. üìÇ Go to the `Tools\Build\win` folder.
3. üëü Run `bootstrap.bat` for it to download all Rust-related DLLs.
4. üìí Open the solution found in `Carbon.Core\Carbon.Core.sln`.
5. üöÄ Develop, build and have fun.

When building locally there a set of scripts that can help you during the development cycle, those scripts are located on the `Tools\Build\` folder, we have windows and linux scripts available.
To export your own artifacts locally, run the `Tools\Build\win\build_debug.bat` script.
This will create a `Releases` folder on project's root with the `.dll` and `.zip` files.
